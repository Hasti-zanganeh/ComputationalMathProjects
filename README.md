# Foundations of Computational Mathematics (MATH 708) - Fall 2023

This repository contains programming assignments, projects, and solutions developed during the **Foundations of Computational Mathematics (MATH 708)** course at the University of South Carolina, Fall 2023.

### Course Description
The course provides an in-depth exploration of numerical methods and computational techniques, focusing on:
- Approximation of functions using algebraic polynomials, splines, and trigonometric polynomials.
- Numerical differentiation and integration.
- Orthogonal polynomials and Gaussian quadrature.
- Numerical solutions of nonlinear systems and unconstrained optimization.

### Objectives
1. Develop skills in programming and applying numerical algorithms to solve real-world problems in science and engineering.
2. Analyze the accuracy of numerical results and the efficiency of computational methods.

### Repository Contents
- **Homework Assignments**: Code implementations for numerical techniques such as root finding, spline interpolation, numerical integration, and more.
- **Projects**: Comprehensive solutions to final project tasks, including comparisons of interpolation methods, nonlinear systems, and ODE solvers.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of methods and observations for each task.

### Tools and Techniques
This repository primarily uses Python and libraries such as:
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `scipy` for interpolation and solving systems.
- `matplotlib` for visualization of results.
